- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical documentation explaining system design and module interactions

### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration Format**: The new unified `.valknut.yml` configuration format is incompatible with previous versions. Use `valknut init-config` to generate a new configuration file.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CLI Interface**: Some legacy command-line options have been restructured for consistency. Check `valknut --help` for current options.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Output Format Changes**: JSON output schema has been enhanced with additional fields. Legacy parsers may need updates.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Python CLI Deprecated**: The Python-based CLI has been moved to `attic/` and is no longer maintained. All functionality is available in the Rust implementation.

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from pre-1.0 versions:

1. **Update Configuration**: Run `valknut init-config` to create a new `.valknut.yml` configuration file
2. **Update CI/CD Scripts**: Replace Python CLI calls with the new Rust binary (`valknut`)
3. **Review Quality Gates**: Check and update quality gate thresholds in the new configuration format
4. **Test Integration**: Validate that automated tools correctly parse the new JSON output format
