# Phase 2 Clone Denoising System - Structural Gate Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive implementation of Phase 2 structural gates for the Valknut clone detection system. Phase 2 eliminates "adjacent one-liners" and low-quality matches by requiring real shared control/data flow structure.

## Implementation Goals ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Basic Block Analysis
- ✅ **Enhanced BasicBlockAnalyzer** with match region analysis
- ✅ **Line range tracking** for precise overlap computation
- ✅ **External call detection** and extraction per block
- ✅ **Matched blocks computation** across pairs of functions

### 2. PDG Motif Analysis  
- ✅ **Comprehensive motif extraction** (control flow, data flow, call graph)
- ✅ **Weisfeiler-Lehman hashing** for structural pattern comparison
- ✅ **Motif categorization** (Branch, Loop, Call, Assign, Phi, Ret)
- ✅ **Shared motif counting** based on WL hashes

### 3. IO/Side-Effects Analysis
- ✅ **External call Jaccard similarity** computation
- ✅ **IO penalty application** when external calls differ significantly
- ✅ **Function call pattern extraction** with regex matching

### 4. Match Region Analysis
- ✅ **Structural overlap metrics** computation
- ✅ **Block-level overlap detection** within match regions
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for rejected matches

## Key Components

### StructuralGateAnalyzer
Main entry point for Phase 2 filtering with three critical gates:

```rust
// Gate 1: Basic block requirement
if matched_blocks < config.require_blocks {
    log::debug!("Rejected: insufficient matched blocks ({} < {})", 
                matched_blocks, config.require_blocks);
    return None;
}

// Gate 2: PDG motif requirement  
if shared_motifs < config.min_shared_motifs {
    log::debug!("Rejected: insufficient shared motifs ({} < {})", 
                shared_motifs, config.min_shared_motifs);
    return None;
}

// Gate 3: IO/side-effect penalty
if external_call_jaccard < config.external_call_jaccard_threshold {
    similarity_score *= config.io_penalty_multiplier;
    log::debug!("Applied IO penalty: external calls differ significantly");
}
```

### Enhanced BasicBlockAnalyzer
- **Line range tracking**: Each block stores precise line ranges for overlap analysis
- **External call detection**: Pattern matching for function calls in each block
- **Match region computation**: Determines which blocks overlap with match regions
- **Jaccard similarity**: Computes external call similarity between matched regions

### Advanced PdgMotifAnalyzer  
- **Control flow motifs**: Branches, loops, exceptions with complexity metrics
- **Call graph motifs**: External function call patterns
- **Assignment motifs**: Data flow and variable assignment patterns
- **Structural patterns**: Sequential control patterns and nesting analysis
- **WL hashing**: Consistent hash generation for motif comparison

### Comprehensive Statistics
- **Phase2FilteringStats**: Tracks filtering effectiveness across all candidates
- **Detailed rejection reasons**: Insufficient blocks, motifs, IO penalties
- **Pass rates and effectiveness metrics**: Real-time analysis of gate performance

## Configuration

### StructuralGateConfig
```rust
pub struct StructuralGateConfig {
    /// Minimum number of matched basic blocks required (Phase 2 Gate 1)
    pub require_blocks: usize,          // Default: 2
    
    /// Minimum number of shared PDG motifs required (Phase 2 Gate 2)  
    pub min_shared_motifs: usize,       // Default: 2
    
    /// External call Jaccard threshold for IO penalty (Phase 2 Gate 3)
    pub external_call_jaccard_threshold: f64,  // Default: 0.2
    
    /// IO penalty multiplier when external calls differ
    pub io_penalty_multiplier: f64,     // Default: 0.7
    
    /// Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations for motif hashing
    pub wl_iterations: usize,           // Default: 3
}
```

## Integration Points

### ComprehensiveCloneDetector
Extended to include Phase 2 filtering:
```rust
/// Apply Phase 2 structural gates to clone candidates
pub fn filter_candidates_phase2(&mut self, candidates: Vec<CloneCandidate>, 
                                code_mapping: &HashMap<String, String>) -> Vec<FilteredCloneCandidate>
```

### DedupeConfig Integration
Phase 2 settings integrated into existing configuration:
```rust
// From existing DedupeConfig
require_distinct_blocks: usize,          // Maps to Gate 1
external_call_jaccard_threshold: f64,    // Maps to Gate 3
wl_iterations: usize,                    // WL hash iterations
```

## Performance Characteristics
