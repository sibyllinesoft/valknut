# React Error #31 Analysis Report

## Test Results Summary

After applying the previously identified React error #31 fixes and running comprehensive Playwright tests, **React error #31 is still occurring**.

### Key Findings

1. **React Error #31 Still Present**: Both the "fixed" and "broken" reports show the identical React error:
   ```
   Error: Minified React error #31; visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=31&args[]=object%20with%20keys%20%7B%24%24typeof%2C%20type%2C%20key%2C%20ref%2C%20props%7D for the full message
   ```

2. **No Data Being Passed to React Component**: The analysis data exists in the HTML as a `<script id="tree-data">` element, but this data is never parsed and passed to the React component.

3. **React Component Mounting Issue**: The React component is rendered without props:
   ```javascript
   root.render(React.createElement(window.CodeAnalysisTree));
   // Should be:
   root.render(React.createElement(window.CodeAnalysisTree, { data: parsedData }));
   ```

### Root Cause Analysis

React error #31 occurs when you try to render an object instead of a React element. The issue is NOT in the array filtering or object property access as previously assumed, but rather in how the React component is instantiated.

**Current Problem**: 
- Data exists: 8 refactoring candidates in JSON format
- React component loads: `window.CodeAnalysisTree` exists
- **Missing**: Data parsing and prop passing to component

### Required Fix

The React mounting script needs to:

1. **Parse the embedded data**:
   ```javascript
   const treeDataScript = document.getElementById('tree-data');
   const analysisData = JSON.parse(treeDataScript.textContent);
   ```

2. **Pass data as props**:
   ```javascript
   root.render(React.createElement(window.CodeAnalysisTree, { 
       data: analysisData 
   }));
   ```

### Test Evidence

**Playwright Test Results**:
- Fixed Report: ❌ React error #31 still present
- Tree Component: ❌ Not loading (0 tree nodes rendered)
- Data Available: ✅ 8 refactoring candidates in embedded JSON
- Error Count: Same in both reports (1 React error each)

### Next Steps

1. Fix the React component data passing in the report template
2. Ensure the React component can handle the data structure properly
3. Re-test with Playwright to validate the fix

### Files Affected

- Report template: Need to modify React mounting script
- React component: May need to handle empty/missing data gracefully

### Conclusion

The previous fixes addressed symptoms but not the root cause. React error #31 persists because the React component is being instantiated without the required data props, causing the component to fail during rendering when it tries to process undefined/null data structures.
