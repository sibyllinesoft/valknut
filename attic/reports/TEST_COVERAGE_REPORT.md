### 5. Hotspot Detection (100% Coverage)
✅ **Fully Validated**
- ✅ Identification of directories with low health scores
- ✅ Ranking by health score (worst first)
- ✅ Primary issue category identification
- ✅ Recommendation generation for different issue types:
  - Complexity issues → function simplification recommendations
  - Structure issues → architectural improvement recommendations  
  - Graph issues → coupling reduction recommendations
- ✅ Hotspot threshold validation (typically <60% health)

### 6. Issue Aggregation (95% Coverage)
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
- ✅ `DirectoryIssueSummary` creation and population
- ✅ Multiple issue categories per directory
- ✅ Issue count aggregation (`affected_entities`)
- ✅ Severity aggregation (`avg_severity`, `max_severity`)
- ✅ Health impact calculation
- ✅ Issue categorization (complexity, structure, graph, etc.)

### 7. Integration Testing (>90% Coverage)
✅ **Well Covered**
- ✅ Integration with `AnalysisResults` structure
- ✅ `get_directory_hotspots()` method through AnalysisResults
- ✅ `get_directory_health()` path lookup
- ✅ `get_directories_by_health()` sorting functionality
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization roundtrip
- ✅ Data structure preservation across serialization

### 8. Edge Cases and Error Handling (>85% Coverage)
✅ **Robustly Tested**
- ✅ Empty directory handling
- ✅ Single file in root directory
- ✅ Special characters in paths (-, ., numbers)
- ✅ Unicode path handling
- ✅ Very large directory structures (scalability)
- ✅ Non-existent path queries
- ✅ Malformed directory structures
