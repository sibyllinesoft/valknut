# Homebrew Setup Summary for Valknut

## What's Been Completed

1. **Successfully Built Valknut on macOS**
   - Cloned the repository from https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/valknut
   - Installed Rust toolchain (stable-aarch64-apple-darwin)
   - Built the project with `cargo build --release`
   - Binary is located at `target/release/valknut` (1.99 MB)
   - Verified the binary works: `valknut --version` returns `valknut 0.1.0`

2. **Created Homebrew Formula Structure**
   - Created a separate homebrew tap directory: `homebrew-valknut/`
   - Created `Formula/valknut.rb` for the Homebrew formula
   - Added README.md for the tap
   - Created release script at `scripts/release.sh`
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `HOMEBREW.md`

## Current Status

The project is ready for Homebrew distribution, but needs the following steps to be completed:

### 1. Create GitHub Release
```bash
# Tag the current version
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v0.1.0

# Create a release on GitHub and upload the binary
```

### 2. Publish Homebrew Tap
Create a new repository `sibyllinesoft/homebrew-valknut` and push the tap:
```bash
cd ../homebrew-valknut
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Homebrew tap for Valknut"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/homebrew-valknut
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Update Formula with Release URL
Once the release is created, update the formula with:
- The actual release tarball URL
- The SHA256 checksum of the tarball

## Files Created

- `/Formula/valknut.rb` - Homebrew formula (in valknut directory)
- `/homebrew-valknut/Formula/valknut.rb` - Homebrew formula (in tap directory)
- `/homebrew-valknut/README.md` - Tap documentation
- `/scripts/release.sh` - Release automation script
- `/HOMEBREW.md` - Comprehensive Homebrew setup guide
- `/HOMEBREW_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Testing the Installation

Once published, users will be able to install with:
```bash
brew tap sibyllinesoft/valknut
brew install valknut
```

For development/testing:
```bash
brew install --HEAD sibyllinesoft/valknut/valknut
```

## Next Steps

1. Push the changes to the main valknut repository
2. Create a GitHub release with the v0.1.0 tag
3. Create and push the homebrew-valknut tap repository
4. Test the installation from the tap
5. Consider submitting to homebrew-core once the project is stable

The project successfully builds on macOS and is ready for Homebrew distribution!
