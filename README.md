  **High-Performance Code Analysis for Modern Development Teams**
</div>

Valknut provides comprehensive code analysis through advanced statistical algorithms and graph-based analysis. While other tools count lines and check syntax, Valknut analyzes code complexity, identifies architectural debt, and provides actionable refactoring recommendations with quantified impact. Built in Rust for production speed and integrated with CI/CD for automated quality gates.

**Stop guessing what needs refactoring. Get data-driven insights that improve code maintainability.**

## Quickstart

### Installation

#### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap sibyllinesoft/valknut
brew install valknut
```

#### Via Cargo (recommended)

```bash
cargo install valknut-rs
```

#### Build from Source (requires Rust 1.70+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/valknut
cd valknut
cargo build --release
```

### Get Results in 30 Seconds

```bash
# Analyze your codebase and get actionable insights
./target/release/valknut analyze ./src

# Generate team-friendly HTML report
valknut analyze --format html --out reports/ ./src

# Set up CI/CD quality gates (fails build if thresholds exceeded)
valknut analyze --quality-gate --max-complexity 75 --min-health 60 ./src
```

**That's it.** Valknut will analyze your code structure, complexity, and technical debt, then provide prioritized recommendations for improvement.

## What Makes Valknut Different

### Statistical Code Analysis
Traditional tools analyze syntax. Valknut analyzes **patterns and complexity**. It uses advanced statistical algorithms to evaluate code structure, identify complexity hotspots, and detect architectural anti-patterns that impact maintainability.

### Production-Ready Performance
Built in Rust with SIMD optimizations, Valknut analyzes large codebases in seconds, not minutes. Designed for enterprise-scale projects with 100k+ files while maintaining sub-linear memory usage.

### Quantified Technical Debt
Get concrete metrics on technical debt with prioritized recommendations. Know exactly which refactoring will provide the highest impact and where to focus your team's effort.

### Zero-Configuration CI/CD Integration
Drop into any CI/CD pipeline with quality gates that fail builds when code quality degrades. No complex setup required.

### Multi-Language Support
Comprehensive structural analysis for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and more. Each language parser understands syntactic patterns and provides language-specific complexity insights.

## Core Capabilities

**Structure Analysis**: Identifies architectural anti-patterns and organizational debt that impacts maintainability

**Complexity Intelligence**: Goes beyond cyclomatic complexity to measure cognitive load and refactoring priority

**Code Quality Analysis**: Statistical evaluation of code patterns, structural complexity, and maintainability metrics

**Refactoring Recommendations**: Actionable insights with quantified impact scoring and effort estimation  

**Dependency Health**: Detects circular dependencies, architectural chokepoints, and coupling hotspots

**Technical Debt Quantification**: Measurable debt metrics with ROI analysis for refactoring efforts

## Configuration

### Quick Setup

# Generate a starter configuration
valknut init-config --output valknut.yml

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Code Quality Gate
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Valknut
        run: |
          # Install from crates.io
          cargo install valknut-rs
      
      - name: Run Quality Gate
        run: |
          valknut analyze \
            --quality-gate \
            --max-complexity 75 \
            --min-health 60 \
            --format html \
            --out quality-reports/ \
            ./src
      
      - name: Upload Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: quality-reports
          path: quality-reports/
```

### Jenkins Pipeline

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Code Quality Gate') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    valknut analyze \
                      --quality-gate \
                      --max-issues 50 \
                      --max-critical 0 \
                      --format sonar \
                      ./src
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Development Workflow Integration

```bash
# Pre-commit hook
valknut analyze --fail-on-issues ./src

# Code review preparation  
valknut analyze --format markdown ./src > REVIEW.md

# Continuous monitoring
valknut analyze --format json ./src | jq '.health_score'
```

## Advanced Usage

### Preset Profiles

Valknut now ships with tuned presets that make it easy to get started without memorising dozens of flags:

```bash
# Lightning-fast sweep focusing on structure + complexity
valknut analyze --preset fast ./src

# Balanced defaults (equivalent to manual flags you know today)
valknut analyze --preset default ./src

# Deep dive with clone detection, denoising, and strict validation
valknut analyze --preset deep ./src

# CI-friendly profile optimised for predictable output
valknut analyze --preset ci ./src
```

Presets can still be combined with individual flags â€“ explicit CLI options always win. They are applied before merging config files so you can treat them as opinionated starting points for teams.

> **Tip:** advanced clone-detection tunables (e.g. `--ast-weight`, `--min-saved-tokens`) now require the `--advanced` switch. This keeps the day-to-day CLI compact while still exposing expert controls when you need them.

### Output Formats

```bash
# Interactive HTML reports for teams
valknut analyze --format html --out reports/ ./src

# Machine-readable JSON for automation
valknut analyze --format json ./src

# Markdown reports for documentation  
valknut analyze --format markdown ./src

# CSV data for spreadsheet analysis
valknut analyze --format csv ./src

# SonarQube integration format
valknut analyze --format sonar ./src
```

### Advanced Analysis Options

```bash
# Custom configuration
valknut analyze --config custom.yml ./src

# Specific analysis types
valknut analyze --skip-refactoring ./src

# Large codebase optimization
valknut analyze --max-files 50000 --parallel 8 ./src

# Language-specific analysis
valknut list-languages
```

## Future Work

Advanced clone detection and boilerplate learning remain under active development. These
work-in-progress capabilities are kept on dedicated branches until they reach production
quality to ensure the published crate only advertises supported functionality.
