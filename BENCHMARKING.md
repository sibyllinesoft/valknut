# Benchmarking Policy for valknut

## Overview

This document outlines the benchmarking policy for **valknut** by Nathan Rice, licensed under the Sustainable Programming License (SPL) v1.0.

## Benchmarking Guidelines

### Permitted Benchmarking Activities

1. **Academic Research**: Benchmarking for academic research, comparison studies, and educational purposes is encouraged.

2. **Performance Analysis**: Objective performance testing to understand software characteristics, limitations, and optimization opportunities.

3. **Compatibility Testing**: Testing to ensure interoperability with other systems, frameworks, or platforms.

4. **Security Assessment**: Responsible security testing and vulnerability assessment.

### Requirements for Benchmarking

#### 1. Methodology Transparency
- **Reproducible Methods**: All benchmarking methodologies must be clearly documented and reproducible.
- **Fair Comparison**: Comparisons with other software must use equivalent configurations, datasets, and testing environments.
- **Statistical Rigor**: Results must include appropriate statistical measures (confidence intervals, significance tests, etc.).

#### 2. Responsible Disclosure
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Any security vulnerabilities discovered during benchmarking must be reported privately to nathan.alexander.rice@gmail.com before public disclosure.
- **Grace Period**: Allow reasonable time (typically 90 days) for vulnerability fixes before public disclosure.
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Follow established responsible disclosure practices.

#### 3. Publication and Citation Requirements
- **Proper Citation**: Any published results must properly cite this software using the information in CITATION.cff.
- **License Acknowledgment**: Published benchmarks must acknowledge the SPL license and its terms.
- **Contact Information**: Include nathan.alexander.rice@gmail.com as a contact for questions about the software.

#### 4. Data and Results Sharing
- **Benchmark Data**: When possible, benchmark datasets and results should be made available to the community.
- **Methodology Documentation**: Detailed methodology should be shared to enable reproduction and verification.

### Prohibited Benchmarking Practices

1. **Unfair Comparisons**: Using artificial or biased scenarios that unfairly favor or disadvantage this software.

2. **Malicious Testing**: Using benchmarking as a pretext for attacks, unauthorized access, or system disruption.

3. **Misleading Claims**: Publishing results that misrepresent the software's capabilities, limitations, or intended use cases.

4. **License Circumvention**: Using benchmarking to reverse-engineer proprietary aspects or circumvent license terms.

## Collaboration Opportunities

### Research Partnerships
Nathan Rice welcomes collaboration on benchmarking projects that:
- Advance the state of knowledge in relevant fields
